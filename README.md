# Movies-Recommedation-
movies recommendation system based only on the overview of the movies, this method is called content-based recommedation system,
i used TFIDFVECTORIZER for feature extraction and sigmoid kernel/cosine similarity to measure how similar the documents are. both have the same result.
this system can be used for books/music aswell
