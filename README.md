# Movies-Recommedation-
Recommender systems encompass a class of techniques and algorithms which are able to suggest “relevant” items to users. Ideally, the suggested items are as relevant to the user as possible, so that the user can engage with those items: Movies,YouTube videos, news articles,songs,and so on.
in this project we will deal with movies Recommendation, but the Recommender system can work with any kind of data with the same features (movies overview or movies ratings)
Recommender systems are generally divided into two main categories: collaborative filtering and content-based systems.
the main diffrence between both is the content-based deals with the story behind the movies and get you recommendation depending on the movie overview, while Collaborative filtering methods for recommender systems are methods that are solely based on the past interactions between users and the target items. Thus, the input to a collaborative filtering system will be all historical data of user interactions with target items. This data is typically stored in a matrix where the rows are the users, and the columns are the items.

the dataset used for:
content-based recommender system >>> imdb 5000 movie dataset
Collaborative filtering system>>The Movies Dataset 
both are available on kaggle
